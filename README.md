# 🍎 Apple VS Pineapple 🍍    
### 🔥 *A battle between apple and pineapple* 🔥


*Apple VS Pineapple* is a mobile multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe that we can enjoy with friends, family, or with somebody in the world. 

The rule is the same as other tic-tac-toe games, get three in a row!! 

But, the difference between *Apple VS Pineapple* and other tic-tac-toes is, as you can imagine, we use Apples🍎 and Pineapples🍍 instead of X and O. 

Enjoy *Apple VS Pineapple* 🎉🎉

###### For now you can *see* other players, but you cannot *play* with other people.🙏 
###### So, It's a single play for now. A developer will work hard and fix this problem.
